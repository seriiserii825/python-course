def averageHeight():
# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student
# height from a List of heights.
# . student_heights = (180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146)
# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights
# together and dividing by the total number of heights.
# eg.
# 180 +124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
# There are a total of 7 heights in =tudent heights
# 1146 + 7 = 163.71428571428572
# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
# Important You should not use the Â«sum () o 1en() functions in your
# answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you
# have learnt abost for loops. e N >

# Example input
# 156 178 165 171 187
# In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178,
# 165, 171, 187)
# Example Output
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

# 61 on hima
# I List o tagent bdahca 156 170 165 171 147

# Hint
# 1. Remember to use the =cusci() function to round the average
# height before you print i
